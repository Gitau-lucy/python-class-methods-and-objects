# python-class-methods-and-objects

“There is a proposal to come up with a simple system which will have two classes. One of the classes is the base class while the other is the sub class. The base class will store three data members namely product name, quantity and price. The sub class will have two member methods, one of the methods will read the values of the data members then pass those values to another method which calculates the cost of the product inclusive of the value added tax (VAT) and displays the result”.
